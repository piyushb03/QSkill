<h2> Sentiment Analysis </h2>
<body>This project is a Flask‑based Sentiment Analyzer that helps uncover the emotions behind text input. 
  Users can type any sentence or paragraph, and the app evaluates its polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) 
  and subjectivity (objective vs. opinionated). The results are displayed with a clean, modern interface, dynamic progress bars, and responsive design. </body>
